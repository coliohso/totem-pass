        <div style="max-width: 38em; margin-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.85; color: var(--fg);">

          <p>I wanted to say something. There was something I wanted to say. I had to say that. This is something that I enjoy. I enjoy participating in the reorganization of language. Simply reorganizing language is fun to me. And in my opinion, poetry is a single entity. There's just one thing called poetry, that for lack of a better word we call poetry. And in my opinion, the way I see poetry, is that each poem is just part of the one poem—every poem that individuates itself has been sectioned off from the one poem that there is. And there's only one poem. So whenever you choose to show part of the poem, it should be like a game. It should be like a celebration, but it should be filled with reverence and almost terror, but just a kind of lightness and superciliousness that supersedes any supersession. And it's really—when I do something that's most akin to writing, my role as an author is more as a reader and as a curator. As a cutter of the cloth. An arbitrator. A designator, just an active witness of the continual movement of language that passes before me, where I stick my hand out and stop the flow at a certain point. And take joy in the arbitrary gesture of sectioning off. And there's the experience of reading as writing. Each thing written is only ever written twice. Nothing is ever written once.</p>

          <p> Another essential part of my ethos as an author, or what is sort of consistent with this way of seeing—with Monism of poetry, or poetic Monism—is the fact that the role of the artist is not a special privileged position. It's a humble position. And it's understood that everyone has a role. In this system, everyone has a part to play. No one is special because everyone is special. Everyone contributes. Everyone should write. Everyone writes, everyone writes poetry, everyone participates in the continual stream of words and language and communication, building the world's spirit through language—everyone participates. No single word or phrase is better and more important than another. There's an ever-widening contradiction that builds the spirit of the people, one by one, which is also its undoing. It's continual restructuring and reflection upon itself through the others, through recognizing how it is different from itself. Continually discovering its own self-difference. And never obeying the logic of non-contradictory truths. And never settling in self-sameness. And this is a simple part of life, and it's not a special heightened version of life, but is life itself. It's almost the most foundational base level of life. And the same is for all forms of writing and drawing and manipulation of material in general, be it psychic or physical. No matter the medium. There's nothing. There is so much nothing to say. So we keep saying it. There's nothing to say, so we say it. Differently, every time.</p>

          <p>I also think it's important to note that I don't see my way of seeing poetry as the best way to see it. I just see it as the way that I am forced to see it—the way I naturally see it. It's a way that makes most sense to me. It's a way that comes most naturally for me in my way of dealing with language. And to the contrary, actually, I wish it were otherwise. I try—well, maybe not hard enough—but I try to accept a version of creating with language that is more disciplined and rigorous in formal arrangement, in verse and meter. I wish it made more sense to follow certain rules that would give me more concrete and manageable objects that are aesthetically valid and verifiable under established rubrics. And it still may be the case that I can succeed in a more constraint-based model. And that is all well and fine, but it's important to me to give credit to the way of seeing that comes most naturally to me and the legacy that it derives from and contributes to—which is all of the many proceedings that precede this one that have been guided by chance. All kinds of writing that are chance-based in their method. And all the methods of madness where they reflect the madness of method in their defiance of a final say and their humble refusal of the egoic organizer who would bend and distort the will of chance. So the point being not to reify the monism of poetry, but to see it as one mode among many—and the necessary resulting contradiction that lies therein.</p>

          <p>What follows from this way of seeing also is that readers should not look to especially erudite individuals for illumination, or that certain writers that are, quote unquote, good writers should not be seen as sovereign soothsayers to the common man, but that the soothsayer himself should be common, that all people should participate in the truth-telling. In a way of totally leveling the playing field of the weight of meaning. That all meaning should be derived from the reader as writer and participation in the continual stream, and not that some words, some sections of the one poem have been given special status by some tribunal of veracity. Which then should have the effect of empowerment upon individuals who can then dip their hands in their own stream, in the stream that flows from them and through them back into the self-differentiating source.</p>
